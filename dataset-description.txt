We have 3 different dataset:
Nucleus Fingerprint region of the Raman spectra (600-1800 cm-1)
Nucleus High-wavelength region of the Raman spectra (2800-3100 cm-1)
Cytoplasm Fingerprint region of the Raman spectra (600-1800 cm-1)
Each one should be analyzed independently.
This dataset is that obtained from the pre-processing procedure, so they have been already processed by background
subtraction, baseline correction, outlier test (this is why some measurements are missing: they were outliers), normalization.
Each dataset is organized as a matrix. In the first row we have the Raman shift (X axis of our spectrum plot).
In the first column, the measurement label (number of cell.number of measurement: For example measurement 1.1 is the
first measurement of the cell 1). The second column corresponds to the cell type:
	- HepG2, an immortalized cell line used as a tumor cell model for liver cancer
	- NorNon: Normal non cultured cells from a patient with liver cancer but in an area away from the tumor mass (healthy)
	- MalN/MalNoN: Malignant non cultured cells from a patient with liver cancer
	- Mal/MalCult: Malignant cultured cells from a patient with liver cancer and cultured to support viability
